## An ESP8266 and WS2812b LED Parking Assistant

Fork from [Resinchem](https://github.com/Resinchem/ESP-Parking-Assistant)

This version is a dewifid version.

I had no wifi reception in my garage which left the non secure access point open.
So simply removed everything wifi related to make this work quickly.
All the settings are at the top and can be simply changed to personal needs.

I used an AZ-Delivery ESP8266-12F module and the Arduino EDE 2.0.3. The board is called ''LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 mini (clone)'' in the IDE under ''ESP8266 Boards (3.0.2)''.

Thanks to Resinchem for creating the original version!
